{
    "faceDetectionFrequency":"Higher frequency yields better detection due to more scans. Requires more computer performance",
    "faceDetectionNeighbours":"Higher number reduces the amount of false positives. May result in fewer detections",
    "faceDetectionScale":"Higher number improves computer performance and results in lesser detection of smaller objects.",
    "faceMovementSampleAmount":"More samples means slower movement can be detected",
    "faceMovementThreshold":"Higher number means longer movement needs to happen but reduces chance of false positive",
    "faceMovementErrorThreshold":"Lower number means higer likelyhood of detecting a movement jerk. However it also can correct legit movements",
    "faceMovementErrorSampleAmount":"Higher number means more samples are used for error correction. Decreases false positives but might overcorrect legitimate movement"
